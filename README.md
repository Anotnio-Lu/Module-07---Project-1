Once the user inputs their vin number, they are redirected to the landing page. The user is presented with their vehicles make, model, and year, and (if the user has allowed location services) mechanics located within a variety or radii from their current location. 

If the user navigates directly to the landing page, they are presented with a search input box, and placeholders for each of the search results and Google Maps results. The user is able to use the search function from the landing page.

From the landing page, users are able to view their search history, which is preserved using local storage. Users are able to clear their search history by clicking the "clear history" button. 


## Development

RepairFind was developed by Team 7, as a joint effort. Antonio Liu and Anna Art provided the JavaScript, API functionality, and local storage capabilities. Steven Dong and Briony Sherrell designed the website, ensured all technologies were incorporated into the HTML, and provided the READ.ME file.
